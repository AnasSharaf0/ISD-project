   <h2>African Animals-Incredible Moments On Safari
</h2>
   <p>Going on a safari in Africa is one of the most thrilling adventures in the
        world. There is nothing more exciting than seeing African
         animals roaming free on the great plains. We have been on safari in
          South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania, Namibia, and Botswana. We are truly
          lucky people.

   <h2>Canada Churchill, Manitoba </h2>
   <p>We always thought that you had to see the polar bears in the winter. 
       We had visions of massive glassed-in buggies crossing the 
       white tundra landscape packed with people in search of the 
       great polar bear. We never thought of walking with polar bears.

   <h2>Skydive Dubai



</h2>
   <p>Skydiving in Dubai is an amazing and surreal experience.
        Soaring up to a whopping altitude of around 13,000 feet,
         jumping off into the vast sky from a plane, and free-falling at 
         a high speed of 120 miles per hour is nothing but an exquisite and
          spellbinding feeling that is sure to offer you an experience of 
          a lifetime. You can feel all your senses awake and get captivated 
          as you perform your activity in the deep blue sky.

   <h2>Skydive Hawaii


 </h2>
   <p>Skydive Hawaii has mixed feelings.
        The tandem master and jump staff are awesome,
         the views are incredible and you will not regret jumping over
          the beautiful shores of Hawaii. However, the customer service--or
        lack thereof--from the front desk staff needs improvement.
